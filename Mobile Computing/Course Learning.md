Bearer Services: Data transmission services (e.g., SMS).
Supplementary Services: Call waiting, call holding, call forwarding, etc.
2.3 GSM Security
Authentication: Uses the A3 algorithm to validate subscribers.
Encryption: A5 algorithm secures data communication.
Anonymity: Uses TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) to protect user identity.
3. Advanced Mobile Technologies
3.1 GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
Overview: A 2.5G service providing packet-switched data for mobile devices, bridging the gap between GSM and 3G.
System Components:
SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node): Manages mobile data sessions.
GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node): Connects mobile networks to external data networks like the Internet.
PDP Context: Defines data session parameters and quality of service.
3.2 Multiplexing Techniques
FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access): Divides frequency bands for different users.
TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access): Allocates time slots for each user to share the same frequency.
SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access): Uses spatial filtering to direct signals to specific users.
3.3 MANET (Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks)
Routing Protocols: Essential for dynamic, self-organizing mobile networks without fixed infrastructure.
Types of Routing:
Proactive: Continuously maintains routing information (e.g., OLSR).
Reactive: Establishes routes only when needed (e.g., AODV).
Hybrid: Combines proactive and reactive approaches (e.g., ZRP).
4. Mobile Application Development
4.1 Wireless Markup Language (WML)
Concept: Similar to HTML but optimized for mobile devices with small screens and limited bandwidth.
Structure: Uses cards and decks to organize content, enabling navigation and user interaction.
4.2 WMLScript
Features: Procedural language for adding interactivity to WML pages, similar to JavaScript but designed for mobile limitations.
Applications: Used for local user interaction, input validation, and accessing mobile device functions.
4.3 Mobile Security Protocols
WTLS: Adapted from SSL/TLS for securing mobile communications with minimal overhead.
Authentication: Ensures that only authorized users can access network resources.
5. Wireless Communication Technologies
