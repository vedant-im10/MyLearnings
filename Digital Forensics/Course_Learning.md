**4.2 Addressing Data-Hiding Techniques**
- Steganography: Techniques used to hide data within images, audio, or video files. Tools like Steghide, DeepSound, and OpenStego were used in practical labs to detect hidden information.
- Encryption: Understanding the basics of encryption and methods to break or bypass encryption during forensic investigations.

### 5. Legal and Ethical Considerations
**5.1 Legal Standards and Frameworks**
- Information Technology Act, 2000: Provides legal recognition to electronic records and outlines the guidelines for handling digital evidence.
- Admissibility in Court: Digital evidence must meet certain criteria, such as relevance, integrity, and authenticity, to be considered admissible.
- Global Standards: Regulations like GDPR and ISO 27037 outline best practices for collecting, handling, and storing digital evidence.

**5.2 Ethical Practices in Digital Forensics**
- Maintaining Objectivity: Forensic experts must maintain impartiality, ensuring that their analysis and conclusions are based solely on the evidence.
- Privacy Concerns: Forensic investigations must respect individual privacy rights while ensuring compliance with legal obligations.
