# Object-Oriented Programming with Java - Comprehensive Course Summary

## Course Overview
The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java course provided an in-depth understanding of OOP principles, their implementation in Java, and their application in real-world software development. This course covered a wide array of topics, from fundamental OOP concepts to advanced techniques such as design patterns, UML modeling, and Java-specific features like memory management and multithreading. The curriculum was designed to give students both the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary to design, implement, and maintain scalable and efficient software systems.

### 1. Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming
**1.1 Classes and Objects**
- Concept: Classes are the blueprints for objects. They define the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that the objects created from them will have. Objects are instances of classes, representing real-world entities within a program.
- Key Points:
  - Attributes: Data fields or properties of a class (e.g., int age, String name).
  - Methods: Functions or procedures that define the behavior of objects (e.g., void displayName()).
  - Constructors: Special methods used to initialize objects when they are created.
- Example:
```
class Student {
    int rollNumber;
    String name;

    Student(int r, String n) {
        rollNumber = r;
        name = n;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Roll Number: " + rollNumber + ", Name: " + name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student(101, "Alice");
        s1.display();
    }
}
```

**1.2 Encapsulation**
- Concept: Encapsulation is the mechanism of restricting access to certain components of an object and protecting object integrity by preventing unauthorized or inconsistent changes.
- Key Points:
  - Access Modifiers: private, protected, public—control the visibility of class members.
  - Getter and Setter Methods: Provide controlled access to private attributes.
- Example:
```
class Employee {
    private int salary;

    public void setSalary(int s) {
        if(s > 0) {
            salary = s;
        }
    }

    public int getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}
```

**1.3 Inheritance**
- Concept: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass), facilitating code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships.
- Key Points:
  - Single Inheritance: Java supports single inheritance, where a class can extend only one superclass.
  - Method Overriding: Subclass can override methods of the superclass to provide specific implementation.
- Example:
```
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();  // Inherited method
        d.bark(); // Subclass-specific method
    }
}
```

**1.4 Polymorphism**
- Concept: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying data types.
- Types:
  - Compile-time Polymorphism: Method overloading—same method name with different parameters.
  - Run-time Polymorphism: Method overriding—subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
- Example:
```
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape s = new Circle();  // Upcasting
        s.draw();  // Calls the draw method of Circle class
    }
}
```

**1.5 Abstraction**
- Concept: Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.
- Key Points:
  - Abstract Class: Cannot be instantiated, can have abstract (unimplemented) methods.
  - Interface: A contract that classes can implement, defining methods without body.
- Example:
```
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.sound();  // Output: Barks
    }
}
```

### 2. Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Techniques

**2.1 Design Patterns**
- Concept: Design patterns are standard solutions to common problems in software design, providing templates for writing code that is modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Key Patterns:
  - Singleton: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
  - Factory: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
  - Observer: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
  - Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separates an application into three interconnected components: Model (data), View (user interface), and Controller (business logic).
- Example:
```
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**2.2 Unified Modeling Language (UML)**
- Concept: UML is a standardized modeling language used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of software systems. It is crucial for designing object-oriented systems.
- Key Diagram Types:
  - Class Diagrams: Show the static structure of the system, including classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
  - Use Case Diagrams: Capture functional requirements by modeling the interactions between actors and the system.
  - Sequence Diagrams: Detail the flow of control between objects over time.
  - Activity Diagrams: Represent workflows, showing the sequence of activities and decisions within a process.
  - Component and Deployment Diagrams: Illustrate the physical architecture of software systems.
- Example Use Case: Modeled a COVID-19 hospital management system, detailing interactions between patients, doctors, and system processes.

**2.3 Memory Management in Java**
- Concept: Understanding Java’s memory management is crucial for writing efficient and effective applications. Java manages memory using a combination of stack and heap, with garbage collection handling unused objects.
- Key Points:
  - Heap Memory: Used for dynamic memory allocation (objects, arrays).
  - Stack Memory: Stores primitive data types and references to objects in heap.
  - Garbage Collection: Automatic process of reclaiming memory by deleting objects that are no longer reachable in the program.
- Practical Tip: Avoid creating unnecessary objects and leverage memory management best practices to optimize performance.

**2.4 Multithreading and Concurrency**
- Concept: Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently, sharing CPU time and resources. Proper synchronization is required to avoid issues like race conditions.
- Key Points:
  - Thread Creation: In Java, threads can be created by extending Thread class or implementing Runnable interface.
  - Synchronization: Used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads, preventing data inconsistency.
- Example:
```
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c = new Counter();
        // Create multiple threads to increment count
    }
}
```

**2.5 File I/O and Serialization**
- Concept: Java provides comprehensive support for file handling, allowing for reading from and writing to files. Serialization enables converting an object into a byte stream, which can then be saved to a file or transmitted over a network.
- Key Points:
  - File Handling: Use FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter for file operations.
  - Serialization: Achieved using ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream classes.
- Example:
```
import java.io.*;

class Employee implements Serializable {
    String name;
    int id;

    Employee(String n, int i) {
        name = n;
        id = i;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Employee emp = new Employee("John", 101);
            FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("employee.ser");
            ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
            out.writeObject(emp);
            out.close();
            fileOut.close();
        } catch (IOException i) {
            i.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
