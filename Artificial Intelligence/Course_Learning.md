## Course Structure and Key Learnings
### Unit 1: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**
- Definition and Evolution:
  - AI is defined as the science of making machines intelligent, with the ability to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
  - The course covered the evolution of AI from symbolic AI to machine learning and the recent surge of deep learning techniques.

  - AI applications span various industries, including healthcare (diagnosis, treatment planning), finance (fraud detection, algorithmic trading), robotics (automation, navigation), and autonomous vehicles.

**Problem Solving and Search Techniques**
- Problem Formulation and State Space Representation:
  - Problems are represented as state spaces, consisting of an initial state, a set of possible actions, and a goal state. Search strategies explore these states to find a path to the goal.

- Uninformed Search Algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level. Guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph but can be memory-intensive.
  - Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking, using less memory but without guaranteeing the shortest path.
  - Uniform Cost Search: Expands the node with the lowest path cost, suitable for weighted graphs where costs vary.

- Informed Search Algorithms:
  - Greedy Best-First Search: Uses a heuristic to select the node that appears closest to the goal, focusing on short-term gains.
  - A* Search Algorithm: Combines path cost and heuristic information to find the most efficient path to the goal, balancing exploration and exploitation effectively.
  - Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing: Local search techniques that optimize by evaluating neighboring states, with Simulated Annealing allowing for probabilistic jumps to escape local optima.

  - Predicate logic extends propositional logic with quantifiers and predicates, allowing for more complex and detailed knowledge representation, including relationships between objects.
  - Application of logical connectives, quantifiers, and inference rules to derive new facts from known facts.

- Production Systems and Frames:
  - Production systems represent knowledge as a set of rules (IF-THEN statements) used for decision-making.
  - Frames are data structures representing stereotyped situations, providing a structured and organized way to handle large amounts of information about entities.

- Semantic Networks and Ontologies:
  - Semantic networks represent knowledge in graphs where nodes represent concepts, and edges denote relationships.
  - Ontologies provide a formal framework to model complex knowledge domains with classes, attributes, and relationships, used in AI for reasoning and understanding context.

**Reasoning and Inference**
- Inference Mechanisms:
  - Forward Chaining: Data-driven approach that applies rules to known facts to infer new facts, used in expert systems.
  - Backward Chaining: Goal-driven approach that works backward from the goal to determine the required conditions, commonly used in logic programming and expert systems.
  - Resolution and Unification: Techniques used in automated theorem proving and logic-based reasoning systems to combine facts and derive conclusions.

- Probabilistic Reasoning:
  - Bayesian Networks: Graphical models representing probabilistic relationships among variables, used for reasoning under uncertainty in domains such as medical diagnosis.
